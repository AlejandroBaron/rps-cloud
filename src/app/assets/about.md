Hi! I'm Alejandro Bar√≥n, a Computer Engineer & Statistician. I like working with Machine Learning in all stages of the process; concepting the algorithm, training and testing models and then deploying it.

I created this project as a template/baseline project to have a fully functional complete stack for any Machine Learning project. Since this is a "full ML stack" blueprint, some parts of the project are simple, like the model or the databse.

The idea is to keep increasing the project and/or reusing it in different tasks. Right now, it covers:

- Databases
- Model Monitoring
- Model training (Learns every time a user plays the game)
- Hosting the model (not in an API fashion)
- Data visualization

It uses Markov Chains for the model architecture, PyWebIO for the website and PostgreSQL for the datase. The whole app is deployed on cloud (Heroku) with Terraform
