Hi! I'm Alejandro Bar√≥n, a Computer Engineer & Statistician. I like working with Machine Learning in all stages of the process; concepting the algorithm, training and testing models and then deploying it

I created this project as a template/baseline project to have a fully functional stack for any Machine Learning project. However, the main purpose of this app was to exercise my infrastructure skills, so that's why I started with a very simple model.

The idea is to keep increasing the project to other tasks. Right now, it covers:

- Databases
- Model Monitoring
- Model training
- Hosting the model (not in an API fashion) and making it learn from user usage
- Data visualization

It uses Markov Chains as the model structure, PyWebIO for the website and PostgreSQL for the datase. Docker-compose to simulate hosting locally
