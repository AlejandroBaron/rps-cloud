Hi! I'm Alejandro Bar√≥n, a Computer Engineer & Statistician. I like working with Machine Learning in all stages of the process; concepting the algorithm, training and testing models and then deploying it.

I created this project as a template/baseline project to have a fully functional complete stack for any Machine Learning project. Since this is a "full ML stack" blueprint, some parts of the project are simple, like the model, since the focus is on the infrastructure. 

The idea is to keep increasing the project and/or reusing it in different tasks. Right now, it covers:

- Databases
- Model Monitoring & Data visualization
- Model training (Learns every time a user plays the game)
- Hosting the model (not in an API fashion)

It uses Markov Chains for the model architecture, PyWebIO for the website and PostgreSQL for the datase. The whole app is deployed on cloud (Heroku) with Terraform. It's in an early stage so it might need further tuning!
